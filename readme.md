# Adobe Tech Summit 2015 React Lab

This is the stock TodoMVC example for Backbone.js. We're going to be taking this code and converting it to use React instead of Backbone views and Underscore templates.

## Getting Started

Some browsers, notably Chrome, require you to have a local web server in order for this app to work.

For Windows users: if you don't already have a static web server that's easy to use, I suggest that [Fenix](http://fenixwebserver.com/) will get you up and running with a minimum of fuss. No configuration required: just point it at this directory and you're ready to run.

For Mac users: you can also use [Fenix](http://fenixwebserver.com/) as suggested for Windows. Mac users also have a super simple server already installed you can run from the command line. Just open a terminal window to this directory and run:

```sh
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

The server will start on port 8000.

## Lab Instructions

The step-by-step instructions for this lab can be found in [StepByStep.md](StepByStep.md).

# Backbone.js TodoMVC Example

> Backbone.js gives structure to web applications by providing models with key-value binding and custom events, collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling, and connects it all to your existing API over a RESTful JSON interface.
